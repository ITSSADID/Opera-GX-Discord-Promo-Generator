# hello, world!
so, this is rewrite of `@JOY6IX9INE`'s OperaGX promo generator, but without any ratelimits *(doesn't require proxies! yipee!)*
this is made with some headers added to part, also little rewrite of code and now discord support, so you can run it on your own server!

# how do i install it?
1. install via git: `@ git clone https://github.com/bruhb0y/Opera-GX-Discord-Promo-Generator/`
2. install .py file: `https://github.com/bruhb0y/Opera-GX-Discord-Promo-Generator/blob/main/main.py`

# soo.. what's new in here? why SHOULD I use it?
1. discord webhook support! you can now use it for your private server, or do it for public. i don't give any flying.. uh...
2. no more proxies. yippe!! no need to buy proxies!!!! *thank you so much for method, traili on discord!*
3. well, no colors. yea. just boring white color.

# okay, i got it, its cool. how DO I run it?
1. install it. 2 methods how are in "how do i install it?" part
2. on `line 3` put your discord webhook.

3. just do `python main.py`
4. tada! 🎉

# on running i get "`> amount of threads:`. what do i put?
more threads - more checking. it also takes your pc/vps/whatever/you/use resources, but works faster. thats it.

# oh wow, thats pretty good. can i get authors?
big shoutout to original creator of generator: `https://github.com/JOY6IX9INE`
same shoutout to man, who found out method to bypass 429: `@traili` on discord!
